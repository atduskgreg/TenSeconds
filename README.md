## Ten Seconds

### TODO

* Add button pressed state
* Maybe gray background for menu? (animation to and from gray background)
* Save time of final run for tutorial as last time
* Animate arrow shape when jumping
* Add music
* Better death indications: sound, on-screen graphics over frozen screen, something
